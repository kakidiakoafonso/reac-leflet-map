# Leaflet react map

Build a simple map application to mark and describe points on the map.

##Expected features:
1. User can mark a point on the map and assign basic information to it (title, description and creation date). Point can be added by input coordinates to a form field.
2. Marked points should be saved in the browser's memory and should exist after the application's page refresh.
3. Show all added points on the map.
4. On click/hover on a point marker should display a tooltip with information mentioned in the point 1.
5. User can remove existing point.

* Language: TypeScript
* UI library: React
